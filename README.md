## Getting Started

This repository aims to explain the process of how I handled the project. Since the task has also a presentation part, I will keep this repository as technical as possible. Then I will filter my findings out and create more representable insights for my non-technical audience.



## Exploratory Data Analysis

The first thing I noticed in the given Census data some of the columns are missing such as 'total_earnings' or 'adjusted_gross_income'. These are missing on purpose for creating the task. Here is the full list of which columns are missing:
```
* adjusted gross income
* federal income tax liability
* instance weight
* total person earnings
* total person income
* taxable income amount
```
The other first thing was understanding what is **Not in Universe** means because most of the features have it. It implies that the person was not a part of the population to which the question was directed.
